| Description :                 |  The New York Knickerbockers, commonly referred to as the Knicks, are a professional basketball team | 
|                               |  based in New York City, New York. The Knicks are part of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Confer| 
|                               |  ence in the National Basketball Association. The team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of | 
|                               |  the founding members of the Basketball Association of America, which became the NBA after merging wi| 
|                               |  th the rival National Basketball League in 1949. The team plays at Madison Square Garden, above Penn|

|                               |  BA teams still located in its original city. The Knicks were successful during their early years and| 
|                               |   were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in | 
|                               |  1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing effo| 
|                               |  rts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter. It was not until the late | 
|                               |  1960s when Red Holzman became head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Hol| 
|                               |  zman successfully guided the Knicks to two championship titles in 1970 and 1973.                    |
